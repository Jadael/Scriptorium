# Scriptorium Prototype

## Overview

This is a minimal prototype of Scriptorium, a document processing and analysis tool. The current implementation demonstrates the basic framework and workflow, including document processing, placeholders for LLM integration, and a simple CLI interface.

## Current Functionality

1. Basic document processing: Extracts frontmatter and main content from Markdown-like text.
2. Placeholder for content summarization.
3. Placeholder for LLM integration.
4. Simple CLI interface for user interaction.
5. Basic unit tests for core functionality.

## Running the Prototype

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the CLI interface: `python main.py`
3. Run tests: `python -m unittest tests/test_core.py`

## Next Steps for Development

1. Core Framework Enhancement:
   - Implement actual LLM integration using GPT4ALL bindings.
   - Develop a robust error handling and logging system.
   - Create a task queue management system for processing multiple documents.

2. Text Operations Module:
   - Implement actual text summarization functionality.
   - Develop outline generation, content extraction, and text comparison features.
   - Integrate advanced text operations with the LLM.

3. Metadata Management:
   - Implement full YAML frontmatter parsing and manipulation.
   - Develop a tagging system for documents.

4. Advanced LLM Integration:
   - Implement context window management for improved LLM performance.
   - Develop advanced prompting techniques (few-shot, chain-of-thought, etc.).

5. User Interface Improvements:
   - Develop a RESTful API for programmatic access.
   - Enhance the CLI with more features and better user experience.
   - Implement a progress reporting system for long-running tasks.

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement caching mechanisms for document processing and LLM responses.
   - Optimize for parallel processing where applicable.

7. Testing and Refinement:
   - Expand test coverage with more unit tests and integration tests.
   - Implement performance benchmarking.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing.

8. Documentation and Deployment:
   - Create comprehensive user and developer documentation.
   - Prepare deployment scripts and procedures.
